         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Two Houſes of Parliament, by Your Majeſties Command, were laſt Convened, they have with great care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the State of the Kingdome: They finde Your Majeſty engaged in a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54397:3"/>ſharp and coſtly Warre, oppoſed by mighty Princes, and States, that are in conjunction againſt us, they ſee with ſorrow, the greateſt part of your <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan City</hi> buried in aſhes. Theſe are <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> indeed, and fit only for the adviſe of a Loyal Parliament. But, SIR, looking more narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things, we found our Body Politick entring into a Conſumption, our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that are the ſinews of War, and the bond of Peace, are much exhauſted; the great aydes which are given to your Majeſty for the maintenance of the War, are but like the blood in its circulation, which will return again, and nouriſh all the parts; but a great deal is yearly tranſported <hi>in ſpecie</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to bring home Apes and Peacocks, and the beſt returns are but ſuperfluities and vanities: We have therefore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly beſought Your Majeſty to ſtop this iſſue of blood, and We hope Your Majeſties moſt ſeaſonable and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54397:3"/>gracious Proclamation, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the future exſpiration of theſe Spirits.</p>
            <p>We have likewiſe been allarum'd from all parts of the Kingdome by the inſolencies of Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, who by their great numbers and bold writings declare to all the World, they are in expectation of a plentifull harveſt here in <hi>England:</hi> But Your Majeſty by Your gracious anſwer to the deſire of Both Your Houſes, Your command for all Officers and Souldiers in Your Majeſties pay to take the Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and Your Proclamation for the departure of Prieſts and Jeſuites out of this Nation, have in a great meaſure ſecured us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Fears.</p>
            <p>When Your Majeſty was pleaſed at the opening of this Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſpeak to us, You commanded.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54397:4"/>Us to finde out the beſt Expedients we could, for carrying on the War with as little burthen to the people as was poſſible. The Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Commons Houſe of Parliament have induſtriouſly applyed themſelves to the conſideration of this matter. They quickly reſolved of a Supply for Your Majeſty ſuitable to your occaſions of 1800000 l. but it hath taken up much of their time, ſo to lay this Ayd, that it may not ſeem a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. A little weight lying alwayes upon one ſhoulder will at length become uneaſie, but being ſhifted ſometimes to the other ſhoulder, there will be ſome refreſhment.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Taxes that have been raiſed theſe Six and Twenty years, were laid upon our Lands, which made us deſire to give them ſome reſt; We have therfore prepared a Poll bill, whereby we have brought in all ſorts of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54397:4"/>perſons, proſeſſions, and perſonal eſtates to give their aſſiſtance to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to eaſe the Land Tax; <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum manibus grande levatur onus:</hi> This Bill we hope will ſpeedily bring in a conſiderable Sum of ready money for Your Majeſties preſent uſe. Wee have likewiſe taken care for ſupplying the remainder of the 1800000 l. by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Bill remaining with us, which in a ſhort time will be ready to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The better to enable your Majeſties good Subjects to pay theſe ſeveral Aydes, and with chearfulneſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your Majeſties future occaſions, We thought it neceſſary to remove a Nuſance out of their way, the infinite number of Forreign Cattel that were daily imported, did glutt our markets, and bring down the prizes both of our home-bred Cattel, and our Lands; therefore we have prepared a Bill for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54397:5"/>the prohibiting the importation of any Forreign Cattel for 7. years.</p>
            <p>We finde your Majeſties Mint is not ſo well imployed as formerly, and the reaſon is, becauſe the ſees and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Officers and Workmen is in part payd out of the Bullion that is brought thither to be coyned, and what is wanting is made up by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: We have therefore for the eaſe of your Majeſty and thoſe that ſhall bring in any Plate or Bullion to be coyned there, made another proviſion by an Impoſition upon Wines, Brandy, or Syder imported from any Forreign Nations.</p>
            <p>Having given your Majeſty this ſhort Account at preſent; We ſhall with Your leave return to perfect thoſe Bills that ſtill remain with Us; and we hope ſo to finiſh them to Your Majeſties ſatisfaction, that all Your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54397:5"/>Majeſties Enemies both at home and abroad may ſee, and feel the effects of this bleſſed Correſpondence between Our Gracious King and his Loyal Parliament.</p>
